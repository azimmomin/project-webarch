* What is a *Web Browser?* :slide:
** Many things :notes:
   + "Thing I type Google into"
   + Loads data from the Internet
   + Displays it
   + Runs Javascript
   + has plugins

* What is the core?  :slide:
  [[file:img/www-gnu.png]]
  + [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb][WorldWideWeb]] (confusingly named) the first browser
  + Tim Breners-Lee wrote it to share data with colleagues at CERN
  + Display HTML with Style Sheets from remote servers
  + Editing was built into the first version
  + Support different Protocols: FTP, HTTP, NNTP, local files
** Symmetric usage :notes:
   + Belief was that one would be creating as much as consuming information
   + Plus, can't build a browser if there's nothing to browse!
   + Already supported protocols for transferring files, reading newsgroups
   + Images originally displayed in a separate window.  Eventually inlined.

* Features :slide:
  + Network access
  + Interpreting the fetched data
    + Possibly fetching and interpreting dependencies like images
  + Rendering HTML with CSS rules
  + Running scripts in the context of the web page
  + Utility functions
** Examples :notes:
   + Network access :: HTTP
   + Fetched Data :: HTML, CSS
   + Rendering :: Displaying a table with row and column lines
   + Scripts :: Validating a password before submitting
   + Utility functions :: tabs, bookmarks, plugins

* Address Bar -> Web Page :slide:
  1. Analyze address bar to determine protocol and server
  1. Connect to server, download data and all dependencies
  1. Analyze HTML, generate a Document Object Model (DOM)
  1. Apply CSS to the DOM
  1. Display the DOM
  1. Start executing scripting code and re-render the DOM as required
  1. Continue executing and interpreting user actions
** Definitions :notes:
   + DOM :: A way of representing the HTML so that it can be analyzed and 
     modified
   + scripting :: programming language designed to work with web pages, eg. 
     Javascript
   + Recursive :: Each of these steps have at many steps underneath them

* Why Separate the Browser from Websites?  :slide:
  + Composability!
  + Improve the features around the website without upgrading the website
    + Original browser did not have Forward Back buttons
  + Accessibility
   + Tradeoff is the layouts need to follow rules, designers must design with 
     multiple audiences in mind
** Flexibility :notes:
   + Separating the content from the presentation allows you more flexibility with how you want to use it
   + What if you could only view websites like a TV image. No cut+paste, viewing on mobile vs. desktop

* Browser or Web Page?  :slide:
  + [[file:img/ie8-logo.png]] Internet Explorer
  + [[file:img/Google_logo.png]]
  + [[file:img/nyt-logo.png]]
  + Firefox [[file:img/firefox-logo.png]]
  + Others?

* Browsers, Apps, Operating Systems :slide:
  + Traditionally, browsers were applications running in an OS like Windows
  + Scripting enables browsers to run their own code
  + Complex web pages (eg. Gmail) behave almost like an application
  + Browsers could become an OS themselves, ala ChromeOS
  + Some Apps now written entirely in Javascript

* Market Share :slide:
  [[file:img/desktopbrowserapril.jpg]]
** Numbers :notes:
   + Significant sampling bias
   + Eg. wikimedia sees 46% Chrome, 11% IE

* Utilities :slide:
  + /Firefly/ for Firefox, /Developer Tools/ for Chrome
  + Enable you to modify the page as you're viewing it
  + Valuable for understanding how HTML and CSS are rendered

* Questions :slide:
   + What is CSS used for?
   + What are some of the utilities you use in your browser?

* Browsing Information Not a New Idea :slide:center:
